Introduction:
As part of the capstone project in Module 1 at Purwadhika, students are challenged to design and implement a system using Python, which incorporates the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The objective is to put into practice the foundational principles of programming while trying to optimize the effectiveness of the system. In this post, we'll be reviewing a Python-based Library System, assessing its code structure, functionalities, and identifying areas of improvement to enhance its performance and effectiveness.

Understanding the Code:
The Library System project is a simple yet effective demonstration of a CRUD application. The system allows users to perform key operations, such as adding new books to the library (Create), viewing all books or specific book details (Read), borrowing and returning books (Update), and deleting books from the library (Delete). The code is organized into several functions, each of which is responsible for a specific operation.

1. Create Operation: The create_book function and add_new_book function are responsible for creating and adding new books to the library.
2. Read Operation: The view_all_books function and view_book_details function allow users to view the details of all books in the library or a specific book.
3. Update Operation: The borrow_book and return_book functions facilitate updating the book's status when a user borrows or returns a book.
4. Delete Operation: The delete_book function enables removing a book from the library.
Recommendations for Improvement:

Certainly, the library system built in Python contains the following features:

1. Borrow a Book: This feature enables a user to borrow a book from the library. A borrower is identified by their ID and name. They can borrow multiple books at once. Once a book is borrowed, the stock decreases, and the borrower's name is recorded against the book.
2. Return a Book: The book return feature allows a user to return a borrowed book. Upon return, the book's stock increases, and the borrower's name is removed from the book record.
3. View Book Details: A user can view the details of a particular book using this feature. By providing the book ID, the user can get the book's title, author, publication year, publisher, and the stock available in a tabular format.
4. View All Books: This feature provides an overview of all books available in the library. It prints out a table with the book ID, title, author, and stock of each book.
5. Add a New Book: A user can add a new book to the library's stock using this feature. The book is identified by a unique ID, and its title, author, publication year, publisher, and initial stock must be provided.
6. Delete a Book: A book can be removed from the library's stock using this feature. A user needs to provide the book ID to delete it. This feature also provides an option to delete multiple books in a row.
7. Main Menu: This feature provides a menu-driven interface to access all other features. It is the starting point of the application and allows a user to choose which operation they want to perform.
8. Exit: This feature provides a way for the user to exit the program from the main menu.

Each of these features has been implemented as a separate function in the code. They work together to create a comprehensive system for managing a library's book stock and facilitating borrowing and returning books.

While the initial implementation is functional and aligns with the CRUD requirement of the capstone project, there are a few areas that can be improved upon:

Use Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulate the library system into a class to avoid using global variables. This will also make the system more organized and scalable.
Input Validation & Error Handling: Enhance the systemâ€™s robustness by adding input validation checks and error handling to avoid crashes due to unexpected user input.
Code Refactoring: Extract repeated logic into separate helper functions to make the code more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and improve readability.
Decomposition of Functions: Break down complex functions into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility. This would improve the code maintainability and readability.
Add More Comments: Enhance the readability of the code by adding comments that provide more context about the function or operation.
In conclusion, it's commendable that the Python-based Library System effectively implements the CRUD operations as part of the capstone project at Purwadhika. However, refining and enhancing code is a continual process. We hope the recommendations provided here help in fine-tuning this project, and also serve as valuable insights for future programming endeavors. Happy coding!
